# The-Impact-of-Data-Preprocessing-on-Machine-Learning-Models

In this case study, you will perform essential data preprocessing steps on the Penguins dataset. The dataset contains information aboutdifferent species of penguins, including their physical characteristics and the region where they were observed. Your goal is to prepare thedataset for machine learning analysis. Follow these steps:
1.
Load the penguins dataset using the code snippet provided below.
2.
Perform initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure, features, and any missing values. Summarize the dataset's statisticsand gain insights into the data.
3.
Address any data quality issues, such as missing values and outliers. Decide on an appropriate strategy for handling missing data, suchas imputation or removal of rows/columns.
4.
Analyze the relevance of each feature for your machine learning task by using the learned use feature selection technques.
5.
If the dataset contains categorical variables, encode them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.6.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models.
7.
Scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure consistent scaling across variables.8.
Apply suitable dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the size of the data while preserving important information.
9.
Validate your preprocessing pipeline by training and evaluating a machine learning model, such as the Random Forest model, on thepreprocessed data. Compare the results to the model trained on the raw data (before feature fi ltering, transformation, and reduction) toensure that preprocessing has improved model performance.
